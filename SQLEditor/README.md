# SQL Editor

_A editor developed using the Qt framework (C++) for writing SQL files mainly for the Firebird database. At present only supports syntax highlighting and no intellisense_    
      
- This was started in the interest of having a better editor for firebird database than the currently available default editor. 
- Its goal was to provide all intellisense and code highlighting which could be easily configurable. 
- It would eventually also perform all its execution in a separate thread thus not freezing the actual client  and causing it to crash which is the biggest issue when using the default editor.
- **Based on:** Qt and C++.
